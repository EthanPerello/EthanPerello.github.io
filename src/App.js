Players purchase land tiles on a dynamically expanding grid and construct residential, commercial, and industrial buildings that affect resident happiness and income rates. The game features real-time economy simulation where buildings must be strategically placed adjacent to roads.

All game data including player balances, tile ownership, and building states are recorded on-chain using Dojo and Starknet. The game includes comprehensive camera controls, building menus, and an interactive leaderboard where players compete for profitability in a persistent online world.`,

The game features NavMesh-driven enemy AI with multiple behavior states (wandering, chasing, attacking) based on proximity detection. Players navigate a 3D environment, engage in real-time combat with enemies, collect gems to progress, and manage their health resources.

Implemented systems include animation state management, collision detection for combat, UI elements like health bars and collectible counters, and game state transitions between menu, gameplay, win, and game over screens. Audio management includes persistent background music and contextual sound effects for player actions and enemy encounters.`,

This project explored whether performance metrics such as graduation and dropout rates could predict school closures and revealed key subgroup disparities.
  
  Data was collected from New York State and NYC databases, focusing on graduation rates, GED attainment, and dropout percentages across race and gender. Dropout rates among male and Black/African American students emerged as strong indicators of future closures.
  
  We used logistic regression to train a predictive model on 2015 data, achieving 99.1% accuracy in cross-validation, and applied it to 2021 school data to identify at-risk institutions.`,

Feature engineering created predictive variables including seed differences, team ratings differences, win percentage discrepancies, and average margin of victory. Multiple machine learning approaches were implemented including Logistic Regression and XGBoost with rigorous validation using season-by-season cross-validation.

The project's most significant innovation was incorporating betting odds data, which substantially improved predictive accuracy by capturing market insights about team strengths, injuries, and public sentiment. The final submission included two top-performing models evaluated using the competition's log-loss metric.`,
